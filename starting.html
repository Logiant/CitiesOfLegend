        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
        This is a role playing game with rules that are under active development.
        We will do our best to fairly resolve PvE and PvP interactions, but we may need to adjust the game mechanics and balance as the turns play out.
        There is some hidden information that may not be available to you without investing actions, such as other players actions that affect your nation, secret cults/societies/organizations within your nation, or most resources and events outside of your borders.
        This is not a good environment for min-maxing your nation's power curve, but we have tried to design a compelling system for RP within your nation and between the players.
        If this sounds like a game you're interested in, then these are the next steps to get started:
        <ul>
          <li> Join the <a href=https://discord.gg/aAtGUrfx>Discord channel</a>
          <li> Create the lore of your nation
          <li> Select a map location
          <li> Generate your nation's statistics (alignment, race, government, specializations, and flaws)
          <li> Think about your first three actions!
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Aetirial - Present Day</h2>
      <p>
      The world of Aetirial has been mysteriously saved from certain destruction.
      Your nation and 1000 of your people have survived the apocalypse, but been transported along with a chunk of your capital city into unfamiliar terrain.
      The people have rebuilt your capital using the remaining supplies, but your once proud settlement is now the size of a village.
      Many questions arise: Is the wilderness nearby safe?
      Have other nations been saved as well? Did any Primordials or Gods survive?
      But most importantly, how will you lead your nation in this new world?
      </p>

      <h2>Create the Lore of Your Nation</h2>
        <p>
        This is a role playing game, and to facilitate role playing you should answer some questions about your nation.
        Your nation’s flavor will grow organically throughout the campaign, but these answers will give you a starting point for roleplaying.
        Briefly describe your nation before the sundering.
        <ul>
        <li>
        Were you a large trading enclave, a warmongering empire, religious isolationists or something else?
        <li>
        Were you at war with any nations or worship any deities?
        <li>
        Who survived the sundering with you?
        Were the survivors all unknown workers in your nation, your personal guard, or noble bureaucrats?
        Did your family survive?
        <li>
        What do your people value (or what are their goals)?
        Do your people value intelligence over strength or do they follow “might is right”?
        Do you have a stratified society or are all men free?
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Select a Map Location</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Roll 1d20 and message Mike (mikewedem#0268) or Logan (Loginaut#9986) to recieve your map
        <li>Select a hex for your capital and message Mike or Logan the coordinates
      </ul>

      <h2>Generate Your nation's Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        With the lore and new map location of your nation selected, determine the stats, specializations, flaws, alignment, government form, and race of the survivors.
        These should be tied in some way to your nation's Lore - what, if anything, can you remember from before the sundering?
        Were you a warrior-king out on parade with your personal bodyguard and courtiers?
        Were you a guild leader negotating a new labor contract with the artesans in the center of town?
        Were you the leader of a band of outlaws who were serindipitously saved from a raging wildfire?
      </p>
      <p>
        Refer to the <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mh1_eKHku0KZ3vBQN4Lh71qmUD9iVqAG7yYdDqat9Gw/edit?usp=sharing>Lawgiver's Tome</a> to design and track the statistics and special mechanics of your nation.
        The official stat and action sheet is coming soon!™
      </p>

      <h2>Play!</h2>
      <p>
      Now that you have designed your new nation, it is time to rebuild!
      Every two weeks we will begin a new turn, corresponding to one season in game (1/4 of a year).
      You will have 3 actions to take during each turn, and each action can use one of your six statistics plus modifiers from specializations and flaws.
      Think about what your first three actions will be, and how it fits into your nation's lore.
      Rememebr that taking multiple actions using the same statistic will split your bonus, so plan to have some diversity.
      Some example actions for your first turn are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scout a hex adjacent to your city - this will reveal information about resources, monsters, or secrets on that hex.
        <li>Train an army unit - this will allow you to perform larger military interactions.
        <li>Build up defenses - this will make it harder for wandering monsters, bandits, and any surviving nations to enter your city unannounced.
        <li>Clear a tile - this will send out militia to attack any hostile creatures in a tile; this is a prerequisite to claiming a tile.
        <li>Claim a tile - this action adds a tile to your nation, such as by mapping out natural traild, building infrastructure, or stationing troops there.
        <li>Build a small structure - building a small structure, such as an open mine, will allow you to start extracting resources from an owned tile
        <li>Build a manufacturing building - this will allow you to convert goods into other types (e.g., berries + barley into spirits) within your city
        <li>Send out hunters and gatherers - this action will increase your food supply, and may reveal information about nearby tiles
        <li>Increase a settlement statistic - e.g., increase loyalty by holding a feast or passing a popular law
      </ul>

      <p>Examples of other actions</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare a magic ritual to predict the weather
        <li>Try to commune with your God(s) to find answers
        <li>Have your spies infiltrate an orc encampment to learn their intentions
        <li>Convert the houses of the poor into barracks
        <li>Appoint a captian of the town guard to improve your militia
        <li>Send diplomats to the elves to broker a trade agreement for ironwood
        <li>Trade wood to a desert nation in return for exotic minerals
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are just examples of actions, not an exhaustive list.
        Be as creative as you'd like when submitting actions, but note that if one action has too many parts (e.g., build a new church then hand out ailms to increase Loyalty) it may be broken into multiple parts at our discretion.

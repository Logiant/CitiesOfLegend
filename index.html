        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Turn 3 </h2>
        <p>
          The days are getting colder, and winter approaches! Those in the first ten (1-10) hexes from the top of the map will experience light to moderate snows and cold temperatures. Those in the south will remain temperate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the changing seasons, new sicknesses have spread throughout Aetirial. Some nations have lost citizens to flu-like symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sorcerous Dominion of Egrolis denounces the human raiders through the orb. They vow retaliation to any who trespass into their jungle, and pledge to build a fortress on every hill to repel invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nation of Elloriand has invited all nearby nations to a grand festival this season, celebrating the flow of new wealth into the city.

        <hr>
        <h2> Turn 2 </h2>
        <p>
          The air has become crisp and cool, many wait with baited breath for the days to begin getting longer again.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been reports that hostile elementals have been found inhabiting the more extreme environments across Aetirial. None who've attempted to make contact with them have returned.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Turn 1 </h2>
        <p>
          A massive storm has been sighted over the eastern inner sea. It has devastated the northern shore, and some onlookers report that it may have been magical in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Norisea has divined the natural attributes of the starfinding nations.
          They urge balance in all things, and warn of imbalance in the elements.
          They will not allow any element to overtake the others:
          <ul>
            <li> Fire: Venomous Demense, Orinyas, Bunula, Nation of the Lost
            <li> Air: Or’i, Negrastir, Opal Wild
            <li> Water: Sangtatem Thalassocracy, Twilight Kinship, Elloriand, Enoriath, Vallasea
            <li> Earth: Ulgarth, Arconis, Norisea
            <li> &#xBD; Air &#xBD; Earth: V Collective. This is unorthodox and confusing.
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who worship deities or pull magic from the weave have found that there power has dried up. Gods are silent and the weave of magic is unfamiliar.

        <h2>The First Night</h2>
        <p>
          The Skyfall is over, your people are safe for the time being.
          You attempt to lead them in your own way, but chaos and uncertainty reigns.
          On the first night, a shooting star is spotted. Soon your people gather to watch a full meteor shower.
          Is it a sign of hope or a bad omen? One of the falling stars lands just outside your city limits, leaving a scar in the land.
          Investigating the crash site, you see a perfectly circular orb, and you hear voices coming from it…
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody is sure who suggested the idea, but some orb holders are attempting to use astronomical observations to work out their relative positions on the continent.
          This effort has taken on the unofficial name of the "star-finding" and is underway this season.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Turn 0 - The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          The world of Aetirial has been mysteriously saved from certain destruction.
          Your nation and 1000 of your people have survived the apocalypse, but have been transported along with a chunk of your city into unfamiliar terrain.
          The people have rebuilt your capital using the remaining supplies, but your once proud settlement is now the size of a village.
          Many questions arise: Is the wilderness nearby safe? Have other nations been saved as well?
          Did any Primordials or Gods survive?
          But most importantly, how will you lead your nation in this new world?
